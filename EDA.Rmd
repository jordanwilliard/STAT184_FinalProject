# Guiding Question (i.e., Research Question): Make a clear statement of a single guiding/research question that will drive your analysis.  It should be phrased as a question that you will try to investigate (i.e., it should have a question mark) 

How has the landscape of political ideology changed throughout the past 100 years? Which states have experienced the most change? Are there any notable long term trends?

# Become acquainted with your data sources:
* Where did you find them?

* Who collected/maintains them?

* When & Why were they originally collected?

* What does a case represent in each data source, and how many total cases are available?

* What are some of the variables that you plan to use

* The R Notebook should include R code chunks & output as well as narrative (bullet list is fine at this stage) as you answer these questions

# Explore intuition related to the research question
* Create some informative plots and summary statistics 

* Describe preliminary observations and intuition about the research question

# TWO Data Sources (at least)
* Primary data:  This is the main data source to be used in your investigation and it MUST NOT be loaded directly from an R package (but API's are fine for example). You should have many cases (e.g., at least hundreds--preferably many thousands), many variables including a mixture of both categorical & quantitative variables.  

* Other data sources: No problem for these to come from an R package--for example, the ZipGeography or ZipDemography data (from DataComputing package) might be useful when joined with primary sources as you investigate some phenomenon in the US. 

* Note: Each data source should be less than 80-100MB--the maximum file size permitted in a GitHub Repo... use sampling to create a reduced version for the purpose of the project if needed as we've done occasionally in exercises and weekly activities.
